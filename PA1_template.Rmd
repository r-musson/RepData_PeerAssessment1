# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r,echo=TRUE}
require(data.table,quietly=TRUE)
#load the raw data
rawActivityData <- read.csv("./repdata_data_activity/activity.csv",as.is=T)

#turn time intervals into a date and time
timestamp <- strptime(paste(rawActivityData$date," ",
                            trunc(rawActivityData$interval/100),":",
                            rawActivityData$interval %% 100,sep="")
                      ,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")

# sometimes easier to work with a date when summing data tables so have date
tempdate <- as.Date(rawActivityData$date)

activity.DT <- data.table(date=tempdate,timestamp=timestamp,
                         steps=rawActivityData$steps)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
